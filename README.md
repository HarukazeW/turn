TURN Client
===========

Public domain.

TURN (Traversal Using Relays around NAT) is essentially a relay server
(e.g. numb.viagenie.ca) that allows communication between two firewalled
nodes behing NAT, not accessible via regular UDP Hole Punching.

This is an example (not reference) posix socket TURN client implementation.
